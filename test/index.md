Hi! My name is Mathana Nair Sreedaran.

Welcome to my page!

I am a Second Year Applied Computing student at Waterford Institute of Technology specialising in Cloud Computing with interests in the Internet of Things, Big Data, AR/VR and Fintech.

I am also particularly interested in the tech and start-up scene in Waterford.

I actively volunteer with 121Digital and am a mentor at Coderdojo Waterford.
